# Assumption
Samsung data (unzipped) and run_analysis.R is on the same directory.

# Merge Data

Inside the function merge_data, we take data from the following text files:

test/X_test.txt will give us the local variable, test_data containing all the 541 columns of raw data in the test set
train/X_train.txt will give us the local variable, train_data containing all the 541 columns of raw data in the training set
activities.txt will give us the local variable, activity_labels containing all the different types of activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, SITTING, etc
train/subject_train.txt will give us the local variable, subject_train containing all the possible subject data inside the training set.
test/subject_test.txt will give us the local variable, subject_test containing all the possible subject data inside the test set.
train/y_train.txt will give us the local variable, y_train containing all the possible label data inside the training set.
test/y_test.txt will give us the local variable, y_test containing all the possible label data inside the test set.

# Transformations of Merge Data

y_train_labels is the merged data table of the label data based on the activity labels for training set because y_train alone tells us just 1, 2,3 when we want to have tha actual labels displayed as WALKING, etc.
y_test_labels is the merged data table of the label data based on the activity labels for test set because y_test alone tells us just 1, 2,3 when we want to have tha actual labels displayed as WALKING, etc.

train_data is the merged data table of the training data with the subject, activity, activity id, and the other 541 variables

test_data is the merged data table of the test data with the subject, activity, activity id, and the other 541 variables

all_data is the merged version of train_data and test_data

# Mean and Standard deviation

Data of extract_mean_std

Inside the function extract_mean_std, we take data from the following text files:

features.txt will give us the local variable, features_data containing all the 541 features and their names
Transformations inside extract_mean_std

mean_std_rows is the subset data from the features_data where just the mean() and std() columns are extracted.
perform a colnames() on the giant data set to have the 3 new columns and the column headers for subject, activity, and activity id
mean_columns is the extracted data from the data_set where the mean() columns are extracted.
std_columns is the extracted data from the data_set where the std() columns are extracted.
mean_std_column_vector is the vector containing the mean_columns and std_columns and sorted.
extracted_data_set is the final data table containing the mean and std columns and the 3 additional columns of Suject, Activity, and Activity Id
melt_data_and_write_tidy_set

Data of melt_data_and_write_tidy_set

All local variables inside this function are all derived after transformations
Transformations inside melt_data_and_write_tidy_set

melted_data is the data after performing melt_data on the data_set parameter so that we can isolate down to just 66 observations.
tidy_data is the data after performing dcast on the melted_data so that we can get the mean of the related activities across the different variables of the data.
col_names_vector is the data vector containing new formatted column headers where we replace mean() with Mean, std() with Std, and BodyBody with Body
tidy_data will then be "crowned" with the new column headers from col_names_vector
